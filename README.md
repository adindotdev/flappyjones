# Flappy Jones

Project by me (Adin Kwok), Jaden Mazzone, and Michael Rhee.

A modified version of the world renowned Flappy Birds.

The game revolves around my high school computer science teacher, Mr. Jones.

Includes heavily modified sprites and minor smali edits.

Credits to the original creator of the game, Dong Nguyen.
